        Developers get to align with others on project visions and make designs come to life. It’s not just about making something look good, but also creating something engaging, easy to use, and enjoyable to interact with. Every project becomes a user-focused, creative mission!</section>

        <div className="triangle"><p>
        While I’ll always love making fun and goofy side projects, I’m excited to take my creative strengths, problem solving skills, and curious mindset and use them alongside a team in a professional setting.

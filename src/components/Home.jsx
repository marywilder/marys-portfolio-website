        <section className="intro">The thing I love most about the world of software development - it's usable, interactive art! Whether it’s a small business website, a user form, or an arcade game, each has a unique style, mood, and function. 
        Designers and developers get to come together on project visions and make designs come to life. It’s not just about making something look good, but also creating something engaging, easy to use, and enjoyable to interact with. Every project becomes a user-focused, creative mission!

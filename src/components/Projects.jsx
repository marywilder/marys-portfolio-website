              <img className="project-preview" src={spacewebsite}/>
              <p>Multi-page, mobile-first design, using React Router, Create React App, React Hooks, CSS flexbox and grid, and CSS animations. This was a Frontend Mentor challenge; I was provided with the Figma, then built the site from scratch with no repos or codebase. </p>
              
              
            </a>

            <h2>Weather Website</h2>
              <img className="project-preview" src={weatherapp}/>
              <p>Working with APIs and JSON, I created a vanilla Javascript weather app. This app uses the Google Places API, the Open Weather App API. Users can enter in the name of any city or state. I also illustrated the weather icons and wrote logic that tells the icons to change depending on the weather.</p>

            <h2 >Tic Tac Toe</h2>
              <img className="project-preview" src={tictactoe}/>
              
              <p>This project was built using React compiled through Vite. I used React Hooks to provide functionality for player names and to dynamically show who's turn it is. I also had a lot of fun with this one, using CSS gradients and creating a grainy effect.</p>

              <img className="project-preview" src={todolist}/>
              
              <p>This project was built using React/React Hooks. Users can enter in a to-do list item, mark it complete, and clear completed to-dos. Again, here, I added a bit of fun with my own personal touch by making it look like an actual piece of paper.</p>

              <p>This project I was really excUsing Vanilla Javascript, I honed my skills with arrays, array methods, scope, setInterval() and more. I also drew some funny extra characters that you can play as rather than the original Doodle.</p>

              <p>Another challenge from Frontend Mentor; built using Vanilla Javascript, event listeners, mutating DOM, and CSS animations.</p>

            <h2 >Portfolio Website</h2>
            <p>This is the website you are on as we speak! Built mobile-first using React, React Router, React Hooks, CSS Radial Gradients, CSS flexbox. Created a responsive mobile navbar that includes CSS animations and transitions. I enjoyed combining different radial gradients and CSS filter() to create the siteâ€™s aesthetic.</p>

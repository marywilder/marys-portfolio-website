        <h1 className="title title-span">about me</h1>
        <p>Forever curious, and looking for a career that I was genuinely interested in, I decided to take the plunge and pursue Front End Engineering. As a self-taught developer, I am someone who is highly self motivated and  always looking to grow and learn more.</p>
        
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        
        <p>I have completed an extensive certifcate in Front End Engineering from Codeacademy this past year. CSS, (Flexbox, grid, animation, responsive development),  Vanilla Javascript, HTML, React, React Router, Redux, AJAX, Test Driven Development, JSON, Git, Vite, and CRP are some of the skills I feel excited to put to use.</p>
        
            
        <p>Graduating with a Bachelors in Communication Studies at Ohio University, I have many soft skills, including strong interpersonal and organizational Communication, and am so excited to use those skills working on a team. </p>

        <h2>A little more about my journey</h2>

        <p>The past couple years, I have ran a very successful art business (digital illustrations and landscapes) through Etsy and other online eccomerce sites. I have worked with individual clients and businesses to help them achieve their vision, and it has been so fun. However, as much as I have loved my time pursuing art as a career, I realized doing my own personal art as a fulltime business left me not enjoying it as much. My passion for art and design still remains, and I am so excited to use those design skills in my Front End career. I have strong skills in Color Theory, what looks good, and how to make the Client, or whoever happy with the end result. Check out my etsy here: <a>Mary Wilder Studio</a></p>

        <p>I'm proud of all I've learned on my own and I am so excited to work on a team that will push me to grow and become a better developer.</p>
